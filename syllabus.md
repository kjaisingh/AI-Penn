# AI@Penn Bootcamp - Draft Syallbus
The idea behind each session is to provide a intuitive understanding of one or two Machine Learning model families, and then apply them on a sample dataset using
libraries such as Sklearn and Keras/Tensorflow.

### Session 1
* Slightly more in-depth overview of Logistic Regression (than normal).
* Explanation of Linear Regression (similar concept).
* Dataset: Social media advertisment success prediction (classification).

### Session 2
* Overview of SVMs and K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm.
* Introduce and apply data preprocessing techniques.
* Dataset: Credit default prediction (classification).

### Session 3
* Overview of Decision Tree and Random Forest algorithms.
* Introduce and apply data visualization concepts.
* Dataset: XXX (classification).

### Session 4
* Overview of standard Neural Networks.
* Introduce data normalization concepts (like Dropout).
* Dataset: Predicting outreach/shares of news articles (regression).

### Session 5
* Overview of Long-Short Term Networks (LSTMs).
* Introduce time-series data.
* Introduce using APIs to get live data.
* Dataset: Predicting stock prices using historical data (regression).

### Session 6
* Overview of Convolutional Neural Networks (LSTMs).
* Introduce web scraping.
* Dataset: Differentiating between two types of objects, eg. Football vs Basketball - comparison choice is up to students (classification).
